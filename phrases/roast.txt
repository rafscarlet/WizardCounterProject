They say that without losers there would be no winners... So [WINNER], you should definitely thank [LOSER] for this!
[WINNER] didn't choose the winning life. The winning life chose them. (wouldn't say the same for [LOSER] though...)
[WINNER] definitely deserved this victory! Oh hey [LOSER] when did you get here?
Future generations will certainly remember [WINNER]'s victory today. 
[LOSER], you may have lost the game, but at least you didn't lose your dignity... Oh wait, never mind.
Congratulations [WINNER]! You must be really good at this game. Now, if only you could be as successful in real life...
Congratulations to [WINNER] for proving that miracles do happen, and to [LOSER] for showing us what not to do!
[WINNER] clearly cheated by being talented, and [LOSER] just proved that effort alone isn't always enough...
